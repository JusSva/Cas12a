This is a repository of python code, which was written while working at Jones lab, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, using python 3. The code found here was first used to analyze cleavage kinetics of CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme on off-target sequences, containing a single or dual insertions of the same identity as the adjecent nucleotides. 
The framework was later used to determine cleavage rates and cleavage positions of a different CRISPR enzyme- Cas12a. When working with cas12a, we looked for correlations in off-target sequences (single insertion, deletion or mismatch) and tried correlating it with the distances between nucleotides in a) target DNA chains and b) guide RNA (gRNA) chains. The correlation between those same distances and cleavage postions were also evaluated. The distances were "gathered" from a published crystal structure of Cas12a in PDB (Protein Data Bank. Link: https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5B43), the identifying code: 5b43. The cleavage position and cleavage rate data was taken from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0646-5.
If there are any questions how a particular piece of the code works, feel free to write me at justas.svagzdys@gmail.com
